"""Custom checkout application configuration for Django Oscar.

This module overrides the default Oscar checkout app configuration
to enable custom behavior, such as injecting a custom shipping address view.

    CheckoutConfig: Extends Oscar's default CheckoutConfig to provide
    project-specific configuration and view logic.

    Custom configuration for the checkout app.

    This class extends Oscar's default `CheckoutConfig` to allow
    overriding or extending functionality in the checkout process.

    Attributes:
        default_auto_field (str): Defines the type of primary key to use by
        default.
        name (str): The dotted Python path to the application.

    When the app is ready (i.e., all apps are initialized), this config
    dynamically imports and attaches a custom shipping address view,
    allowing it to be referenced elsewhere (e.g., in URL configuration).
